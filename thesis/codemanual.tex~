%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{dedication}
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{acknowledgements}
%% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***
%\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%

\chapter{User Manual}
This paper is aimed to be a supplement to my masters thesis. One can find the thesis and the program by emailing me at \textcolor{blue}{\href{mailto:feras@uchicago.edu}{feras@uchicago.edu}}.
We will assume that the reader is familiar with python. A basic tutorial for Fenics is available through their website. I will try to be as thorough as possible, but I highly recommend reading the
tutorial before proceeding. Fenics package is extremely useful in solving partial differential equations with obscure geometries while minimizing the required work for setting the geometry
up. The program we will describe here is designed to solve \sch and Poisson equation self-consistently.

The program is divided into five files, main, meshCreator, electronDensity, poisson, and schrodinger. We will explain the functionality of each file in the following sections.
To check if all the packages are installed correctly, unzip the program and type in the following command from a unix terminal window:
\begin{lstlisting}
python main.py 0.0
\end{lstlisting}

Where the number after main.py signifies Fermi level. Running this should reproduce our result from the thesis.


\section{Main}

In main, we have to include the following files:

\begin{lstlisting}
from dolfin import *
from meshCreator import *
from schrodinger import schrodingerEq
from poisson import poissonEq
from electronDensity import electronOccupationState, electronDensityFunction
from scipy import constants as pc
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import time
import sys
\end{lstlisting}

{\it{dolfin}} is important so that we can use FEM in python, {\it{meshCreator}} file defines our function space, {\it{schrodinger}} takes care of the \sch FEM formulation and solution.
{\it{poisson}} is to solve Poisson in FEM formulation. {\it{electronDensity}} is to find the electron density. {\it{scipy}} and {\it{numpy}} are for defining physical constants and efficient arrays.
{\it{matplotlib}} is used for plotting. {\it{time}} and {\it{sys}} are used for timing and writing the solution to a file.

Next, we proceed with our main loop. We start our loop by calling each file as follows

\begin{lstlisting}
#Start of Iteration
k = 0
while k < 10:
  print str(k+1) + ' iteration'
  
  #get the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
  eigenvalues, eigenvectors, u, rx_list = schrodingerEq(potential, meshArray, fermiEnergy)
  
  #find the electron density
  nk = electronOccupationState(eigenvalues, fermiEnergy)
  new_n = electronDensityFunction(eigenvectors, nk)
  
  #solve the poisson equation
  phi = poissonEq(new_n,meshArray)
\end{lstlisting}



\section{Creating a Mesh}
\section{Schrodinger}
\section{Electron Density}



%% *** NOTE ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file and
%% `\include' or `\input' it here).
