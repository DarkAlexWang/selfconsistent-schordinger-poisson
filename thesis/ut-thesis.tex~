\chapter{Introduction}
\hspace{5ex} Modern day electronics have reached scales of extremely small magnitudes, typically, a few hundred nanometers. When we enter this regime, it is important
to take into account quantum mechanical phenomenons as they have a larger impact on smaller scale electronics. These quantum effects will impose
substantial amount of change on device performance. One way to understand the behavior of materials at such scales is to incorporate quantum mechanics along
with semi-classical electrostatics. A complete picture requires a self-consistent solution of both \sch and Poisson equation. These types of systems are
extremely complex to be solved analytically. Therefore, we resort to numerical approximations. Ideally, one would device a numerical simulation flexible enough to capture
wide range of applicability, while at the same time accurate to experimental data. 
A lot of literature have utilized a conventional approach to the solution of \sch and Poisson equation called finite-difference method (FDM). In this paper, we
use another method in finding a self-consistent solution called finite-element method (FEM). The reason why we decided to use FEM is that
it is easy to have complex geometries, such as combinations of cylinders, spheres, and cubes. In chapter 1 we will discuss the formulation of \sch and Poisson
equations in the FEM regime. In chapter 2, we will discuss the theory behind our numerical simulation. Lastly, in chapter 3, we
will discuss the results for a simple two-dimensional heterojunction.

\chapter{Formulation}

\section{Finite Element Method}
\hspace{5ex} More often than not, we need to numerically solve partial differential equations. In this paper, we will use the finite Element
method to study the \sch and Poisson equations. This method is powerful because allows us to solve PDEs for obscure geometries.
 For generic formulation for a PDE of the form
\begin{equation}
 [D] u(x) = f(x) \in \Omega
\end{equation}
 Where D is an arbitrary operator, and $\Omega$ defines our geometry. We have to rewrite this equation in weak variational form so that we can solve it using FEM. Let us consider the
 boundary conditions

 \begin{numcases}{}
  u(x) = u_0(x) & \text{on $\Gamma_D$} \\
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = g_0(x) & \text{on $\Gamma_N$}
\end{numcases}

Where $\Gamma_D$ and $\Gamma_N$ signifies Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition. The general idea of finite element method is to
rewrite a PDE into a variational problem. The way to do that is to introduce an arbitrary function $v$ and multiply the PDE with $v$. 
Then we integrate over the domain $\Omega$ and separate every second-order derivative using integration by parts. The original PDE then can be written
in the weak form as

\begin{equation}
 \int_\Omega [D']( u \cdot v)\; d\Omega + \int_{\Gamma_N} g v \; \partial \Omega = \int_\Omega f v \; d\Omega \;\;\; \forall v \in \hat V
\end{equation}

Where $D'$ is the reduced operator after performing integration by part to the second-order derivatives, and $\hat V$ is
the function space where our arbitrary function $v$ lives. The function $u$ lies in $V$, which could be different than $\hat V$.
Now, to perform the calculation numerically, we need to reformulate the continuous variational problem to a discrete problem.
 We just need to define a discrete space $\hat V_d \subset \hat V$ and $V_d \subset V$ so that we can write our boundary problem as
 
 \begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega [D']( u_d \cdot v)\; d\Omega + \int_{\Gamma_N} g v \; \partial \Omega = \int_\Omega f v \; d\Omega \;\;\; \forall v \in \hat V_d \subset \hat V
 \end{equation}

 It convenient to use unified notation for linear weak forms
 
 \begin{equation}
  a(u, v) = L(v)
 \end{equation}
 
 with
 
  \begin{equation}
  a(u, v) = \int_\Omega [D']( u_d \cdot v)\; d\Omega
 \end{equation}
 
  \begin{equation}
  L(v) = \int_\Omega f v \; d\Omega - \int_{\Gamma_N} g v \; \partial \Omega
 \end{equation}
 
\section{Poisson in weak variational form}
 \hspace{5ex} Here, we want to solve Poisson equation that arises in electrostatics. The general Poisson equation for electrostatics is giving by
 \begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dx}\big(\epsilon_s(x)\frac{d}{dx}\big)\phi(x) = \frac{-q[N_D(x) - n(x)]}{\epsilon_0}
 \end{equation}
 
 Where $\epsilon_s$ is the dielectric constant of the material, $N_D$ is the ionized donor concentration, $\phi$ is our
 electrostatic potential, and $n$ is the electron density. Here, we will only consider a piecewise dielectric constant, therefore, we only
 need to divide the domain into subdomain with different dielectric constants. The Poisson equation can be rewritten as
 \begin{equation}
  \epsilon_s\nabla^2\phi(x) = \frac{-q[N_D(x) - n(x)]}{\epsilon_0}
 \end{equation}
 
 Notice that our operator $[D]$ is replace with $\nabla^2$, and our source term $f(x)$ is replaced with the scaled
 difference of the ionized donor concentration and the electron density. It is pretty straight forward to reformulate 
 the Poisson equation to the weak variational form, all we need to do is to follow the procedure explained in the previous
 section. We get our final weak variational as
 
 \begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega \epsilon_s \epsilon_0 \nabla \phi \cdot \nabla v \;\; d\Omega = \int_\Omega \-q[N_D(x) - n(x)]v(x) \;\; d\Omega
 \end{equation}

 Now can use finite element method to solve for $\phi(x)$.
 
\section{\sch in weak variational form}
 \hspace{5ex} To rewrite Schrödinger's equation in the variational form, we start with \sch's equation in differential form
 
 \begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\frac{d}{dx}\big(\frac{1}{m^*(x)}\frac{d}{dx}\big)\psi(x) + V(x) \psi(x) = E\psi(x)  
 \end{equation}
Where $m*(x)$ is the effective mass. Since we are going to have a constant mass within the region we are exploring, we can
take that out of the derivative. With a little algebra we can rewrite the equation as

\begin{equation}		
 \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*}\nabla^2\psi(x) + [E - V(x)] \psi(x) = 0
\end{equation}

Multiply both sides by a test function $v$. This function is arbitrary with the condition that it vanishes on the boundaries
of our system.

\begin{equation}		
 \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*}\nabla^2\psi(x) v(x) + [E - V(x)] \psi(x) v(x) = 0
\end{equation}

Integrate both terms over the domain and using integration by parts yields

\begin{equation} 
 \int_\Omega \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} d\Omega + \int_\Omega V(x) \psi(x) v(x) d\Omega = \int_\Omega E \psi(x) v(x) d\Omega
\end{equation}

Notice that we drop the surface term because we require that our test function $v$ vanishes where $\psi$ is known.

\chapter{Numerical Simulation}

\section{Relevant Equations}
\hspace{5ex} In this section, we will cover the basic equations that we need to satisfy in our numerical simulation. The basic equations
combines quantum mechanics with semi-classical physics. We need to solve \sch and Poisson using

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sch}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\frac{d}{dx}\big(\frac{1}{m^*(x)}\frac{d}{dx}\big)\psi(x) + V(x) \psi(x) = E\psi(x)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:phi}
    \frac{d}{dx}\big(\epsilon_s(x)\frac{d}{dx}\big)\phi(x) = \frac{-q[N_D(x) - n(x)]}{\epsilon_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:v}
    V(x) = -q \phi (x) + \Delta E_c (x)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nx}
   n(x) = \sum^m_{k=1}\psi^*_k(x)\psi_k(x)n_k
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nk}
   n_k = \frac{m^*}{\pi  \hbar^2} \int^{\infty}_{E_k} \frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/KT}}dE
\end{equation}

Where $\Delta E_c (x)$ is the pseudopotential energy due to the band offset at the heterointerface, $n_k$ is the electron occupation
number which can calculated by Fermi-Dirac distribution function with $E_F$ being the Fermi level, $\psi_k$ is the wavefunction in the $k^{th}$ state,
 and $E_k$ is the eigen energy in state $k$. These five equations have to be solved and produce a self-consistent solution
 in order for us to have a good approximation of the behavior of our system.
 
 \section{Approximations}
 \hspace{5ex} In this section, we will cover the basic approximations that we employ in our numerical simulation. We first start with approximating the occupation number $n_k$.
 since the complete Fermi-Dirac integral is an exponential function
 \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}_j(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma (j+1)} \int^\infty_0 \frac{t^j}{exp(t-x)+1}dt
 \end{equation}
 
 Where $x = E - E_F$. In this paper, we will only consider the two dimensional case, in which $j = -1/2$.
 Since we are taking the integral of $\mathcal{F}_j(x)$ from $E_k$ to $\infty$, we need the argument $E$ to be $E \le 0$. Therefore the distribution function falls
 of exponentially as
 \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}_{-1/2}(E) \sim exp(-E), \;\;\;\; E \gg 0
 \end{equation}

 Therefore, we only need to calculates relatively few quantum states the are lower than Fermi level. The second approximation involves treating $m^*(x)$ as a step function.
 Where it is (for two subdomains) 
 
 \begin{numcases}{m^*(x) = }{}
  a_1 m_e & \text{$\in \;\;\Omega_1$} \\
  a_2 m_e & \text{otherwise}
\end{numcases}
Where $m_e$ is the mass of electron ($\approx 0.511$ MeV), and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are coefficients that depends on the materials.

\section{Algorithm}
\hspace{5ex} In this section, we will describe the process of producing a self-consistent solution. We first start with an arbitrary potential $V(x)$ and 
plug it in equation ~\ref{eq:sch} to solve for the wavefunctions. After we get the wavefunctions, we compute the electron density function
and the occupation number using equations ~\ref{eq:nx} and ~\ref{eq:nk}. Then we can solve Poisson equation because we have $n(x)$. Finally, we use
the solution of ~\ref{eq:phi}, $\phi(x)$, to find the new corrected potential, $V(x)$, using ~\ref{eq:v}. After finding the new potential and the new electron
density, we compute the difference between them and their old values to test for convergence. We repeat this process until we achieve convergence, we choose our criteria for convergence to be on the order of $10^{-5}$ error.

\begin{figure}[th]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{algorithm}
      \caption{A flowchart of the self-consistent simulation}
\end{figure}

\section{Geometry}
\hspace{5ex} We will consider a GaAs/AlGaAs structure for our simulation. We chose GaAs/AlGaAs because it preforms better than most of semiconductors 
at high frequency. Also, GaAs/AlGaAs is pretty much insensitive to temperature. Lastly, GaAs/AlGaAs has a high electron mobility. Ideally,
our simulation would work for all sorts of materials but we will only show GaAs/AlGaAs in this paper. Our wafer is depicted in Figure ~\ref{fig:domain}. Our wafer's boundary conditions at $\phi(0,y) = 0$
and $\phi(1,y) = 0$ at both ends on the $x$-axis, and is periodic, $\phi(x,0) = \phi(x,1)$ on the $y$-axis. Notice that we use normalized coordinate system in which our domain
is $\Omega \in [0,1] \times [0,1]$. The last two boundary conditions take care of the fact that we dope the GaAs layer with $2\times10^{18}$ electrons/$cm^3$.

\begin{figure}[th]\label{fig:domain}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{wafer}
      \caption{Structure of the wafer that we used for our simulation. Here, we use alloy fraction of $\text{GaAs}/\text{Al}_{0.3}\text{Ga}_{0.7}\text{As}$}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Results}
\hspace{5ex} In this section, we will device our efforts to find the right Fermi level that will have a convergent solution while preserving
the properties of the system. We start with Fermi Level of the order $\sim O(10^5)$. From figure ~\ref{fig:fermi5c}, we can
see that Fermi levels of the order $\sim O(10^5)$ are not good candidates for our wafer because they do not reach our
$10^{-5}$ error requirement. We next try Fermi levels of the order $\sim O(10^4)$

\begin{figure}[th]\label{fig:fermi5c}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{fermi5c}
      \caption{shown above is the time it took the simulation to run (in minutes), the error in electron density, and the error in potential plotted against different values of Fermi level on the order of $10^5$}
\end{figure}


For Fermi levels of the order $\sim O(10^4)$, we get some convergent solutions. Namely, for the Fermi levels $ Ef = 1000.0$, $1500.0$, and $2000.0$ all in 4 iterations.

\begin{figure}[th]\label{fig:fermi4c}

\end{figure}

Next, we Plot the electron density and potential for a Fermi energy in the convergent range.

\section*{Conclusion}
\hspace{5ex} As electronic chips becomes smaller, more work required to determine their electronic properties. When devices reaches the nanometer range, quantum
effects become non-negligible. A self-consistent solution to the \sch and Poisson equation is necessary to get accurate predictions of the system properties. 
Due to the complexity of the system, only numerical simulation are possible. We use FEM to simulate a self-consistent solution
for a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wafer. We achieve convergence for values of Fermi level ranging from $1000.0 MeV$ to $2000.0 MeV$
